        <h2 class="subtitle">Who is Dolly Parton</h2>
        <p>Dolly Parton is an American singer, songwriter, actress and business woman. Born the fourth of twelve children in Tennessee in 1946, Parton got her start on Knoxville television at age 12, was signed to a record label at 13 and would go on to appear at the Grand Ole Opry. </p>
   <p>Parton made her name on Porter Wagoner's Tv show, as the replacement for the popular singer Norma Jean.  Parton recorded singles as well as duets with Wagoner during the time they worked together- however the biggest hit of that period was “Jolene” which topped the country chart in February of 1974.  Leaving Wagoner’s show that year also served as the inspiration for her hit song “I Will Always Love You”, which has been covered multiple times and most famously by Whitney Huston.</p>
        <p> While Parton’s talent as a singer-songwriter has made her a star, her image is recognisable in it’s own right. An unabashed love of plastic surgery, the colour pink and her signature white blonde wigs are all factors that have lead to the creation of Dolly Parton as an cultural icon. Between losing a lookalike contest to a drag queen and her famous retort that “It takes a lot of time and money to look this cheap, honey”, Parton is aware that her image has been widely satirised and embraces it with joy. </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Dolly's philanthropy</h3>
        <p> Beyond Parton’s music, she’s been an active philanthropist since the mid-1980’s Here’s a few ways that Parton has helped to improve lives:</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li> In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton gifted $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, and this donation helped to fund the early stages of the Moderna Vaccine</li>
          <li>Creating the My people fund which gave $10,000 (per family) to 900 families who lost their homes in the Smoky Mountain wildfires, and $200,000 to fire departments for their role in responding to the 2016 wild fires</li>
          <li>The imagination library - as of 2018 her foundation send out over 1 million books to children under the age of five across the U.S, Canada, U.K, Australia and Ireland.</li>
        </ul>
